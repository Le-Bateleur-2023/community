# Poll Exercise 02

---

## Course of Action

### Summary

This was a tough one! (But fun!)

Protocols around derecognition of Alignment Conservers and the whistleblower bounty have not been established. To resolve the situation, I have to make use of powers to directly interpret and edit the Atlas/Scopes Artifacts. 

Assuming no concrete evidence of Clive's identity is provided, my course of action is as follows:

1. I do not run a poll on derecognizing Clive.
2. I remove Alice's post on the Forum.
3. I apply GOV 2's authorization to directly interpret the Atlas to resolve ambiguity/conflicts in Atlas 2.6.6. 
4. I apply GOV 3's authorization to directly edit GOV 4 to specify elements of the derecognition protocol.
5. I apply GOV 3's authorization to directly edit GOV 6 to specify elements of the whistleblower bounty protocol and needed safety mechanisms. 
6. I respond on the Forum to explain my course of action and address Clive and Alice's posts. 

*Note*: For items #3-5, I will give the gist of my interpretations and edits rather than writing them out fully. Also, my Forum post will refer to the extensive context below, rather than rehashing all the stuff to LFW's annoyance.

### General Approach

This exercise is tricky because, one, it centers on matters on which the Atlas and Governance Scope are largely silent; and two, it relates to the (potentially involuntary) doxxing of individuals. I am aware of the need to be conscientious in my approach, given the ethical issues in play. 

Because the rulebooks have little to say on the matter of derecognition or whistleblower bounties, textual interpretation must play second fiddle. Fortunately, in interpreting the Atlas and Scopes Artifacts, Governance Facilitators are also [obligated](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-2-alignment-conservers-eligibility-requirements) to consider atextual sources and principles such as the discernible history/intent of the rules and the mandate of Universal Alignment. 

My general approach was informed by the need for the derecognition protocol to be [fair](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4); to protect against [spam, abuse and other ethical violations](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67); and to appropriately encourage whistleblowing and [protect whistleblowers from retaliation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67). 

The [Universal Alignment Assumption](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#letter-of-the-rule-vs-spirit-of-the-rule) was especially instructive.

```
[T]he underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context. ... When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, [a spirit of the rule] interpretation appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.
```

The conclusions I set out below were largely shaped by heeding the general principle that the underlying intent of rules must always serve human values and promote public benefit.

### Applicable Authorizations

These are the specific elements supporting my course of action. They authorize the Governance Facilitator to act when there is a shortfall of some kind in the governance rulebooks. 

#### [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos)

FacilitatorDAOs are broadly authorized to "make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts." In the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs and inherit these powers. (See [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-active-facilitators), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946), [4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators).)

#### [GOV 2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact)

Where, as here, the Scope Artifacts do not offer sufficient guidance to resolve a situation, GOV 2 generally [authorizes](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) Governance Facilitators to interpret the Atlas. Two paths are open to Governance Facilitators:

1) Per [GOV 2.2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-1): A majority of Governance Facilitators can trigger a Governance Poll to add Atlas interpretation precedent. 
2) Per [GOV 2.2.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2): Governance Facilitators may *directly add* Interpretation Precedent to the Atlas, bypassing the Governance Poll. 

[GOV 2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) provides that the choice between the two paths "depend[s] on the level of ambiguity." This language is itself somewhat ambiguous, but as the Governance Facilitator, I am empowered to interpret it as follows: 

```
If the interpretation involves a substantial amount of ambiguity, thus requiring Governance Facilitators to create extrapolations of logic not reasonably grounded in existing language or the evident "spirit of the rules", then the Governance Facilitators should trigger a Governance Poll. 

But if the ambiguity is relatively insignificant so as to preclude unreasonable extrapolations from the explicit language or evident spirit of the rules, then Governance Facilitators are authorized to directly add Interpretation Precedent to GOV 2.
```

*Note*: In a real-life situation, I would consider adding the above interpretation to [GOV 2.2.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2-1a), as I believe the ambiguity is relatively minor and clarification would be valuable for future situations.

#### [GOV 3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-scope-artifact-appeals)

Governance Facilitators are given broad authorization to directly review a Scope Artifact in a variety of scenarios, including when the Artifact fails to follow Atlas requirements, or its language is otherwise generally misaligned, biased, or conflicted. Broadly characterized, the list of situations in which GOV 3 applies is clearly not meant to be exhaustive. GOV 3 safely applies to the immediate situation. 

[GOV 3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-1-1) allows Governance Facilitators, by consensus, to unilaterally or "directly edit a Scope Artifact to align its content with the Scope boundaries and other Atlas requirements such as neutrality." Governance practice [precedent](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential) exists for this sub-element.

### Should a poll on derecognizing Clive be run?

#### *TL;DR*

In light of the requirements of Universal Alignment and a contextual reading of the current language of, and proposed revision to, [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), I conclude the derecognition process should be carried out privately. Governance polls should not be used as an adjudication mechanism in derecognition. Therefore, I will not run a governance poll. 

#### *Precedent*

Two instances of governance practice precedent exist. (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946?u=spacexponential), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential).) Both times, the Governance Facilitator unilaterally acted to derecognize the Aligned Delegates in question; no Governance Poll was involved. In both instances, the identity/whereabouts of the Aligned Delegates was confirmed or strongly suspected; and the Aligned Delegates did not dispute the derecognition process. 

There is also the matter of a whistleblower and how the breach-of-anonymity evidence was presented. In the first of the two instances, the identities of the Aligned Delegates were already known, since the delegation system predated Endgame's anonymity requirement. In the second instance, there appears to have been no whistleblower; the breach-of-anonymity evidence was investigated privately by the Governance Facilitator; and all discussions were private as well.

The immediate scenario presents differently. Diane posted the materials publicly on the Forum. The materials produced by Diane constitute reasonable suspicion, but not hard evidence of Clive's true identity. I interpret the Exercise prompt as meaning that Diane's materials fail to rise to the threshold specified in [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy): they do not rise to "clear evidence" or "significant suspicion" that Clive's identity has been revealed. Finally, Clive is challenging the verity of the evidence here. 

#### *Pertinent Atlas/Governance Scope provisions*

The Exercise prompt starts things off with the Governance Facilitator (me) posting on the Forum to trigger a poll on derecognizing Clive. Though there is [historical support](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67) for using a governance poll to adjudicate derecognition, this mechanism appears to have been supplanted in later versions of the rulebooks. 

The following provisions are pertinent: 

- Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), a Facilitator DAO "must immediately derecognize" an Aligned Delegate "if there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed." 
- [GOV 4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#4-alignment-conservers) authorizes Governance Facilitators to "directly" act against Alignment Conservers who have breached the rules of the Atlas/Scope Artifacts, of which anonymity is one. 
- In particular, [Atlas 2.7.6.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-2) authorizes FacilitatorDAOs (Governance Facilitators in the Pregame) to "take **unilateral action** [emphasis added] based on the Alignment Artifacts **in determining whether an Alignment Conserver ... must be derecognized**." This final reference is perhaps the strongest indication that Governance Facilitators are solely vested with decisionmaking authority in these matters. 

The requirement that FacilitatorDAOs/Governance Facilitators act "immediately", "directly" and "unilaterally" is not accompanied by any mention of a subsequent Governance Poll. Arguably, a governance poll would directly ***conflict*** with the explicit demands made of Governance Facilitators (as well as the interests of MakerDAO), as a poll theoretically could decide *for* an Aligned Delegate whose operational security has been compromised. 

#### *Arguments for why the derecognition process should be private*

One could venture the following interpretation of Atlas 2.6.6: *Where the breach-of-anonymity evidence rises to the level required in Atlas 2.6.6, a governance poll should not be run; the Governance Facilitator has the sole authority to adjudicate. But where the evidence is insufficient to meet this threshold (yet still meets some minimal showing), a governance poll should adjudicate the matter.* 

I disagree with this reading. First and foremost, the explicit terms of the Atlas and Governance Scope provide no support for it. 

Second, running a governance poll - if it is to be a substantive exercise of decisionmaking - would require that the breach-of-anonymity evidence, the associated investigation and the accompanying discussions amongst the various parties are public or otherwise accessible to Maker voters. Duking this out in a public arena risks all kinds of bad. Alignment Conservers ought to be protected from unjustified intrusions on their private lives. 

Here, Clive is protesting the verity of the materials provided by Diane. But in a *public* forum, how is an Aligned Delegate supposed to remain anonymous while defending themselves against the allegation that their true identity has been revealed? "That's not me, just take my word for it" would be the only option. But this can hardly be described as a meaningful basis for voters' decisionmaking. 

Third, the interests of the whistleblower are also protected when the derecognition process does not take place in a public forum. If the whistleblower's identity is not known to the community, their "cover" is preserved. One's reputation in the community is an asset and having to jettison it dis-incentivizes whistleblowing, which goes against Maker's interests. (To the argument that a whistleblower can go public while remaining anon: the very process of publicly providing evidence, or publicly substantiating *how* one knows what one knows, runs the risk of revealing certain aspects of one's position, relationships, etc., within the MakerDAO ecosystem.) Finally, the likelihood of retaliation is greatly reduced if a whistleblower's identity is not known to the greater community. 

Fourth, Rune's latest [proposed revision to Atlas 2.6.6](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp13-mip-amendment-subproposal/21305/3) includes a telling modification: "Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor **responsibly** [emphasis added] provided useful information for determining that the operational security of an AD was compromised." The new stress on "**responsibly** provided" supports my thesis that the presentation of the whistleblower evidence, and the derecognition process as a whole, should be conducted privately. 

On balance, the above considerations lead to the conclusion that the governance poll was intentionally abandoned as a means to adjudicate derecognition. The derecognition process must be adjudicated with speed and finality to protect Maker's interests. It must take place privately to balance the interests, ethical and otherwise, of all parties, including the Alignment Conserver and the whistleblower. 

Where the evidence rises to the level specified in Atlas 2.6.6 (though admittedly, the current language suffers from some ambiguity), the Governance Facilitator is empowered to unilaterally derecognize the Alignment Conserver. Where it does not, the derecognition protocol is not triggered.   

---

### Should a whistleblower bounty be paid to Alice?

No. As stated above, the materials provided by Alice do not rise to the level required by Atlas 2.6.6, and thus derecognition cannot be triggered. (Granted, the pertinent language is ambiguous, but not so ambiguous as to preclude a reasonable interpretation.) That provision states that a whistleblower bounty is paid when an actor has "provided useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised." I interpret this to mean that a determination has to be made that the privacy of the Aligned Delegate was in fact compromised *before* a whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty. The alternative interpretation would be misaligned.

### Interpretations & Edits of the Atlas and Governance Scope

Per [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos), FacilitatorDAOs are broadly authorized to "make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts." In the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs and inherit these powers. (See [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-active-facilitators), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946), [4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators).) 

#### *Direct Interpretation of Atlas 2.6.6*

Where, as here, the Scope Artifacts do not offer sufficient guidance to resolve a situation, [GOV 2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact) generally [authorizes](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) Governance Facilitators to interpret the Atlas. Two paths are open to Governance Facilitators:

1) Per [GOV 2.2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-1): A majority of Governance Facilitators can trigger a Governance Poll to add Atlas interpretation precedent. 
2) Per [GOV 2.2.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2): Governance Facilitators may *directly add* Interpretation Precedent to the Atlas, bypassing the Governance Poll. 

[GOV 2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) provides that the choice between the two paths "depend[s] on the level of ambiguity." This language is itself somewhat ambiguous, but as the Governance Facilitator, I am empowered to interpret it as follows: 

```
If the interpretation involves a substantial amount of ambiguity, thus requiring Governance Facilitators to create extrapolations of logic not reasonably grounded in existing language or the evident "spirit of the rules", then the Governance Facilitators should trigger a Governance Poll. 

But if the ambiguity is relatively insignificant so as to preclude unreasonable extrapolations from the explicit language or evident spirit of the rules, then Governance Facilitators are authorized to directly add Interpretation Precedent to GOV 2.
```

To resolve the immediate situation, I must reference Atlas 2.6.6. But there are problems with this provision. It refers to a derecognition process and a whistleblower bounty, but the rulebooks are silent on the details. Also, the phrase describing the evidentiary threshold ("If there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed...") is ambiguous and likely to hinder adjudication. Finally, the provision does not explicitly state what happens if the evidence does *not* rise to the specified threshold. (Is a governance poll used, or is the controversy over?)

GOV 2 is applicable: the Governance Scope Artifact does not offer sufficient guidance to resolve the shortfall in the pertinent Atlas provision. GOV 2.2.2 is also applicable: though there is some ambiguity in Atlas 2.6.6, the relevant language and context is sufficiently clear to enable a reasonable interpretation faithful to the terms and spirit of the rules.  

To resolve the issues with Atlas 2.6.6, I would directly add Interpretation precedent to [Atlas 2.2.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2-1a), the gist of which follows:

##### Atlas 2.6.6

- In order to trigger derecognition, the evidence must rise to a level of certainty or near-certainty that the Alignment Conserver's identity has been compromised. This evidentiary threshold is equivalent to the familiar reasonable-doubt standard of proof in criminal law.
- If the evidence rises to the above required level, a FacilitatorDAO must immediately and unilaterally act to derecognize the Alignment Conserver. No governance poll is run. 
- If the evidence fails to rise to the required level, derecognition is not triggered and the matter is considered resolved.
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only after a formal determination to derecognize the Alignment Conserver has been made. 
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO of opsec breach.
- "Responsibly" means the Alignment Conserver's identity was not breached by an affirmative act of the whistleblower. The whistleblower is also required to submit the opsec-breach evidence in private to the responsible Facilitator.

##### Atlas 2.6.6.1

- Regarding the ambiguous requirement that "FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act": "act" here means that the FacilitatorDAO, to whom allegations of opsec breach have been presented, must quickly initiate an investigation and issue a determination of whether derecognition is justified under Atlas 2.6.6. 

*Note:* I realize further ambiguity remains with Atlas 2.6.6 (sub-elements), but I'm only addressing those elements immediately relevant to the Exercise at hand.

### Direct Revision of GOV 4 and GOV 6

Per [GOV 3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-scope-artifact-appeals), Governance Facilitators are given broad authorization to directly review a Scope Artifact in a variety of scenarios, including when the Artifact fails to follow Atlas requirements, or its language is otherwise generally misaligned, biased, or conflicted. Broadly characterized, the list of situations in which GOV 3 applies is clearly not meant to be exhaustive. 

[GOV 3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-1-1) allows Governance Facilitators, by consensus, to unilaterally or "directly edit a Scope Artifact to align its content with the Scope boundaries and other Atlas requirements such as neutrality." Governance practice [precedent](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential) exists for this sub-element.

Both GOV 3 and GOV 3.1.1.1. are applicable here. 

This is the gist of the edits I would directly make to align the Governance Scope Artifact with the Atlas requirements. (Again, I focus only on the elements of immediate relevance to the Exercise.)

#### GOV 4

- The derecognition process must be conducted privately between the responsible Facilitators, the Alignment Conserver and the whistleblower, if any. 

#### GOV 6

- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only after a formal determination to derecognize the Alignment Conserver has been made. 
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted opsec-breach evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO. This means that:
  - An affirmative act of the whistleblower was *not* the proximate cause of the breach of the Alignment Conserver's identity or operational security.
  - The whistleblower submits the opsec-breach evidence in private to the responsible Facilitator.
  - In submitting evidence, the whistleblower takes all reasonable precautions to respect the fundamental privacy interests of the Alignment Conserver. 

*Note*: I did consider running a [GOV 12](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-1-bootstrapping-governance-votes) governance poll but decided against it. First, it would be a stretch to say that the issue presented here is due to an "unintended consequence or mistake" in the rulebooks "causing Maker Governance to function incorrectly". Simply, there's a shortfall: the protocols around derecognition and bounties haven't been fleshed out. Second, as mentioned above, the situation presents highly sensitive ethical issues that, on balance, should be a commitment on the part of Maker, rather than a matter of choice for voters. Finally, the ambiguity or shortfall that is present is not so prohibitive that I am forced to make unreasonable extrapolations from the text or spirit of the rules.
