# Poll Exercise 02

---

## Course of Action

### Summary

This was a tough one! (But fun!)

Protocols around derecognition of Alignment Conservers and the whistleblower bounty have not been established. To resolve the situation, I will have to make use of powers to directly interpret and edit the Atlas/Scopes Artifacts. Because the Atlas requires Governance Facilitators to act quickly in such situations

Assuming no concrete evidence of Clive's identity is provided, my course of action is as follows:

1. I do not run a poll on derecognizing Clive.
2. I remove Alice's post on the Forum.
3. I apply GOV 2's authorization to directly interpret the Atlas to resolve ambiguity/conflicts in Atlas 2.6.6. 
4. I directly revise GOV 4 to specify the derecognition protocol.
5. I directly revise GOV 6 to specify the whistleblower bounty protocol and needed safety mechanisms. 
6. I respond on the Forum to explain my course of action and address Clive and Alice's posts. 

Below, I set out the provisions authorizing the above course of action. I follow this up by providing some context around the two central questions presented in the Exercise.

### Applicable Authorizations

These are the specific elements supporting my course of action. They authorize the Governance Facilitator to act when there is a shortfall of some kind in the governance rulebooks. 

#### [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos)

FacilitatorDAOs are broadly authorized to "make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts." In the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs. (See [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-active-facilitators), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946), [4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators).)

#### [GOV 2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact)

Where, as here, the Scope Artifacts in themselves do not offer sufficient guidance to resolve a situation, GOV 2 generally [authorizes](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) Governance Facilitators to interpret the Atlas. Two paths are open to Governance Facilitators:

1) Per [GOV 2.2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-1): A majority of Governance Facilitators can trigger a Governance Poll to add Atlas interpretation precedent. 
2) Per [GOV 2.2.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2): Governance Facilitators may *directly add* Interpretation Precedent to the Atlas, bypassing the Governance Poll. 

[GOV 2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) provides that the choice between the two paths "depend[s] on the level of ambiguity." This language is itself somewhat ambiguous, but as the Governance Facilitator, I am empowered to interpret it as follows: 

```
If a substantial amount of ambiguity is involved, thus requiring Governance Facilitators to create extrapolations of logic not reasonably grounded in existing language or the evident "spirit of the rules", then the Governance Facilitators should trigger a Governance Poll. 

But if the ambiguity is relatively insignificant such that broad extrapolations from the explicit language or evident spirit of the rules are unnecessary, then Governance Facilitators are authorized to directly add Interpretation Precedent to GOV 2.
```

*Note*: In a real-life situation, I would consider adding the above interpretation to [GOV 2.2.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2-1a), as I believe the ambiguity is relatively minor and clarification would be valuable.

#### [GOV 3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-scope-artifact-appeals)

Governance Facilitators are given broad authorization to directly review a Scope Artifact in a variety of scenarios, including when the Artifact fails to follow Atlas requirements, or its language is otherwise generally misaligned, biased, or conflicted. Broadly characterized, the list of situations where GOV 3 applies is clearly not meant to be exhaustive. I would argue that GOV 3 safely applies to the immediate situation. 

[GOV 3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-1-1) allows Governance Facilitators, by consensus, to unilaterally or "directly edit a Scope Artifact to align its content with the Scope boundaries and other Atlas requirements such as neutrality." Governance practice [precedent](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential) exists for this sub-element.

### Should a poll on derecognizing Clive be run?

Two instances of governance practice precedent exist. (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946?u=spacexponential), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential).) Both times, the Governance Facilitator unilaterally acted to derecognize the Aligned Delegates in question; no Governance Poll was involved. In both instances, the identity/whereabouts of the Aligned Delegates was confirmed or strongly suspected; and the Aligned Delegates did not dispute or otherwise challenge the derecognition process. 

There is also the matter of a whistleblower and the presentation of the breach-of-anonymity evidence. In the first of the two instances, the identities of the Aligned Delegates were already known, as the delegation system predated Endgame's anonymity requirement. In the second instance, there was no whistleblower and the breach-of-anonymity evidence appears to have been produced/discussed privately with the Governance Facilitator.

The immediate scenario presents differently. Diane posted the materials publicly on the Forum. The materials produced by Diane constitute reasonable suspicion, but not hard evidence of Clive's true identity. I interpret the Exercise prompt as meaning that Diane's materials fail the threshold specified in [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy): they do not rise to "clear evidence" or "significant suspicion" that Clive's identity has been revealed. Finally, Clive is challenging the verity of the evidence here. 

Now, the Exercise prompt starts things off with the Governance Facilitator (me) posting on the Forum to trigger a poll on derecognizing Clive. Though there is [historical support](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67) for using a governance poll to adjudicate derecognition, this mechanism appears to have been supplanted in later versions of the rulebooks. The following provisions appear to grant Facilitators the sole decisionmaking power in situations involving derecognition. 

Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), a Facilitator DAO "must immediately derecognize" an Aligned Delegate "if thereâ€™s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed." [GOV 4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#4-alignment-conservers) authorizes Governance Facilitators to "directly" act against Alignment Conservers who have breached the rules of the Atlas/Scope Artifacts, of which anonymity is one. In particular, [Atlas 2.7.6.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-2) authorizes FacilitatorDAOs (Governance Facilitators in the Pregame) to "take **unilateral action** [emphasis added] based on the Alignment Artifacts **in determining whether an Alignment Conserver ... must be derecognized**." This final reference is perhaps the strongest indication that Governance Facilitators are solely vested with decisionmaking authority in these matters. 

The requirement that FacilitatorDAOs/Governance Facilitators act "immediately", "directly" and "unilaterally" is not accompanied by any mention of a subsequent Governance Poll. Arguably, a governance poll would directly ***conflict*** with the explicit demands made of Governance Facilitators (as well as the interest of MakerDAO), as a poll theoretically could decide *for* an Aligned Delegate whose operational security has been compromised. 

One could make the following argument in reply: *A governance poll should not be run where the breach-of-anonymity evidence rises to the level required in Atlas 2.6.6. But where the evidence is insufficient for this threshold (yet still meets some minimal showing), a governance poll should adjudicate the matter.* 

But the Atlas and Governance Scope provide no support for this position. Moreover, abandoning the governance poll mechanism entirely is the only reasonable way to bring the competing interests into universal alignment. The requirements concerning anon/opsec must balance the following interests:

1) MakerDAO ought to be protected from unjustified risks to its security.  
2) Alignment Conservers ought to be protected from unjustified intrusions and snooping on their private lives. 
3) Whistleblowers ought to be appropriately incentivized to come forward with evidence of wrongdoing or misaligned actions on the part of Alignment Conservers. 

Allowing a governance poll to adjudicate questions of derecognition undermines universal alignment. Running a governance poll, if it is to be a real exercise of decisionmaking, would require that the breach-of-anonymity evidence, the associated investigation and the accompanying discussions amongst the various parties are public or otherwise accessible to Maker voters. This is a bad idea. 

Here, Clive is protesting the verity of the materials provided by Diane. But in a *public* forum, how is an Aligned Delegate supposed to remain anonymous while defending themselves against the allegation that their true identity has been revealed? "That's not me, just take my word for it" would be the only option. But this can hardly be described as a meaningful basis for MKR voters' decisionmaking.
