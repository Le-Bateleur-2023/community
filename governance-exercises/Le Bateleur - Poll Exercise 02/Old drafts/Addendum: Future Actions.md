### The Universal Alignment Assumption 

This exercise concerns the (potentially involuntary) doxxing of individuals. I am aware of the need to be conscientious in my approach, given the ethical issues in play. 

Because the rulebooks have little to say on the details of derecognition or whistleblower bounties, textual interpretation plays second fiddle. Fortunately, in interpreting the Atlas and Scopes Artifacts, Governance Facilitators are also [obligated](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-2-alignment-conservers-eligibility-requirements) to consider atextual sources and principles such as the discernible history/intent of the rules and the mandate of Universal Alignment. 

My approach was informed by the need for the derecognition protocol to be [fair and minimize risk to Maker](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4); to protect against [spam, abuse and other ethical violations](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67); and to [protect whistleblowers from retaliation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67). 

The [Universal Alignment Assumption](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#letter-of-the-rule-vs-spirit-of-the-rule) is especially instructive here. It situates Maker's interests within a broader context: 

```
[T]he underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context. ... When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, [a spirit of the rule] interpretation appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.
```

### Thoughts on public vs private forum

If I had been starting from ground zero in this Exercise, I would not have chosen to run a governance vote. 

Granted, there is [historical support](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67) for using a governance poll to adjudicate derecognition matters. (The former Maker Constitution, 10.11.3.4, states, "During the Pregame, all actions of derecognition must be decided through an MKR governance poll...") But this mechanism appears to have been supplanted in later versions of the rulebooks. 

The following provisions are pertinent: 

- Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), a Facilitator DAO "must immediately derecognize" an Aligned Delegate "if there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed." 
- [GOV 4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#4-alignment-conservers) authorizes Governance Facilitators to "directly" act against Alignment Conservers who have breached the rules of the Atlas/Scope Artifacts, of which anonymity is one. 
- In particular, [Atlas 2.7.6.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-2) authorizes FacilitatorDAOs (Governance Facilitators in the Pregame) to "take **unilateral action** [emphasis added] based on the Alignment Artifacts **in determining whether an Alignment Conserver ... must be derecognized**." 

The final reference is perhaps the strongest textual support for the Governance Facilitators being solely vested with decisionmaking authority in these matters. The requirement that FacilitatorDAOs/Governance Facilitators act "immediately", "directly" and "unilaterally" is not accompanied by any mention of a Governance Poll. 

More to the point, I believe adjudicating breach-of-anonymity matters in a public forum runs counter to the Universal Alignment Assumption and the spirit of the rules. Running a governance poll - if it is to be a substantive exercise of decisionmaking - would require that the breach-of-anonymity evidence, the associated investigation and the accompanying discussions amongst the various parties are public or otherwise accessible to Maker voters. Duking this out in a public arena risks all kinds of misalignment. 

Alignment Conservers ought to be protected from unjustified intrusions on their private lives. Here, Clive is protesting the verity of the materials provided by Diane. But in a *public* forum, how is an Aligned Delegate to maintain opsec while meaningfully defending themselves against the allegation that their true identity has been revealed? "That's not me, take my word for it" is not a meaningful basis for voters' decisionmaking. 

Further, the interests of the whistleblower are also protected in a private forum. If the whistleblower's identity is not known to the community, their "cover" is preserved. One's reputation in the community is an asset and having to jettison it dis-incentivizes whistleblowing, which goes against Maker's interests. (To the argument that a whistleblower can go public while remaining anon: the very process of publicly providing evidence, or publicly substantiating *how* one knows what one knows, runs the risk of revealing certain aspects of one's position, relationships, etc., within the MakerDAO ecosystem.) Finally, the likelihood of retaliation is greatly reduced if a whistleblower's identity is not known to the greater community. 

Finally, Rune's latest [proposed revision to Atlas 2.6.6](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp13-mip-amendment-subproposal/21305/3) includes a telling modification: "Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor **responsibly** [emphasis added] provided useful information for determining that the operational security of an AD was compromised." The new emphasis on "responsibly provided" supports the need to establish  guardrails for these ethical concerns and to balance the interests, ethical and otherwise, of all parties, including the Alignment Conserver and the whistleblower.

### Interpretations & Edits of the Atlas and Governance Scope

As Governance Facilitator, my mandate is to preserve Universal Alignment and guard against misalignment threats. I believe I am obligated in this situation to take affirmative action to resolve the ambiguity in the current rules. This would help ensure that similar situations in the future can be reliably adjudicated in an aligned manner. 

#### *Direct Interpretation of Atlas 2.6.6*

[GOV 2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact) generally [authorizes](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) Governance Facilitators to interpret the Atlas. Two paths are open to Governance Facilitators:

1) Per [GOV 2.2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-1): A majority of Governance Facilitators can trigger a Governance Poll to add Atlas interpretation precedent. 
2) Per [GOV 2.2.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2): Governance Facilitators may *directly add* Interpretation Precedent to the Atlas, bypassing the Governance Poll. 

[GOV 2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) provides that the choice between the two paths "depend[s] on the level of ambiguity." This language is itself somewhat ambiguous, but as the Governance Facilitator, I am empowered to interpret it as follows: 

```
If the interpretation involves a substantial amount of ambiguity, thus requiring Governance Facilitators to create extrapolations of logic not reasonably grounded in existing language or the evident "spirit of the rules", then the Governance Facilitators should trigger a Governance Poll. 

But if the ambiguity is relatively insignificant so as to preclude unreasonable extrapolations from the explicit language or evident spirit of the rules, then Governance Facilitators are authorized to directly add Interpretation Precedent to GOV 2.
```

To resolve the immediate situation, I must reference Atlas 2.6.6. But there are problems with this provision. It refers to a derecognition process and a whistleblower bounty, but the rulebooks are silent on the details. Also, the phrase describing the evidentiary threshold ("If there’s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed...") is ambiguous and likely to hinder adjudication. Finally, the provision does not explicitly state what happens if the evidence does *not* rise to the specified threshold. Is the controversy over? If not, what happens next?

GOV 2 is clearly applicable: the Governance Scope Artifact does not offer sufficient guidance to resolve the shortfall in the pertinent Atlas provision. GOV 2.2.2 is arguably applicable: though there is some ambiguity in Atlas 2.6.6, the relevant language and context is sufficiently clear to enable a reasonable interpretation faithful to the terms and spirit of the rules.  

To resolve the issues with Atlas 2.6.6, I would consider directly adding Interpretation precedent to [Atlas 2.2.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2-1a), the gist of which follows:

##### Atlas 2.6.6

- "Clear evidence or significant suspicion" is interpreted as follows: the evidence must rise to a level of certainty or near-certainty that the Alignment Conserver's identity has been compromised. This evidentiary threshold is equivalent to the familiar reasonable-doubt standard of proof in criminal law: if the evidence establishes breach of anonymity beyond a reasonable doubt, then derecognition is triggered.
- If the evidence rises to this required level, a FacilitatorDAO must immediately and unilaterally act to derecognize the Alignment Conserver. No governance poll is run. 
- If the evidence fails to rise to the required level, derecognition is not triggered and the matter is considered resolved.
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only after a formal determination to derecognize the Alignment Conserver has been made. 
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO of opsec breach.
- "Responsibly" is defined further in GOV6. 

##### Atlas 2.6.6.1

- Regarding the ambiguous requirement that "FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act": "act" here means that the FacilitatorDAO, to whom allegations of opsec breach have been presented, must quickly initiate an investigation and issue a determination of whether derecognition is justified under Atlas 2.6.6. 

*Note:* I realize further ambiguity remains with Atlas 2.6.6 (sub-elements), but I'm only addressing those elements immediately relevant to the Exercise at hand.

### Direct Revision of GOV 4 and GOV 6

Per [GOV 3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-scope-artifact-appeals), Governance Facilitators are given broad authorization to directly review a Scope Artifact in a variety of scenarios, including when the Artifact fails to follow Atlas requirements, or its language is otherwise generally misaligned, biased, or conflicted. Broadly characterized, the list of situations in which GOV 3 applies is clearly not meant to be exhaustive. 

[GOV 3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-1-1) allows Governance Facilitators, by consensus, to unilaterally or "directly edit a Scope Artifact to align its content with the Scope boundaries and other Atlas requirements such as neutrality." Governance practice [precedent](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential) exists for this sub-element.

Both GOV 3 and GOV 3.1.1.1. are applicable here. 

This is the gist of the edits I would directly make to align the Governance Scope Artifact with the Atlas requirements. (Again, I focus only on the elements of immediate relevance to the Exercise.)

#### GOV 4

- The derecognition process must be conducted privately between the responsible Facilitators, the Alignment Conserver and the whistleblower, if any. 

#### GOV 6

- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only after a formal determination to derecognize the Alignment Conserver has been made. 
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted opsec-breach evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO. "Responsibly" means that:
  - The whistleblower is a mere conveyor of the opsec breach, and not its *cause*. In other words, an affirmative act of the whistleblower was *not* the proximate cause of the breach of the Alignment Conserver's identity or operational security.
  - The whistleblower submits the opsec-breach evidence in private to the responsible Facilitator.
  - In submitting evidence, the whistleblower takes all reasonable precautions to respect the fundamental privacy interests of the Alignment Conserver. 

*Note*: I did consider running a [GOV 12](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-1-bootstrapping-governance-votes) governance poll but decided against it. First, it would be a stretch to say that the issue presented here is due to an "unintended consequence or mistake" in the rulebooks "causing Maker Governance to function incorrectly". Simply, there's a shortfall: the protocols around derecognition and bounties haven't been fleshed out. Second, as mentioned above, the situation presents highly sensitive ethical issues that, on balance, should be a commitment on the part of Maker, rather than a matter of choice for voters. Finally, the ambiguity or shortfall that is present is not so prohibitive that I am forced to make unreasonable extrapolations from the text or spirit of the rules.
