# Poll Exercise 02

## Course of Action

### Summary

In the Exercise Prompt, I interpret "course of action" to encompass the immediate steps of responding to the Forum thread and other pre-drafting needs.

Assuming no further evidence concerning Clive's identity is provided, my course of action is as follows:

1. Given the need to minimize risk to Maker, I interpret Diane's materials as rising to the level of "significant suspicion," as required by Atlas 2.6.6.

2. Before derecognition can proceed, however, the Atlas requires a "check" on my decision in the form of a review from FacilitatorDAOs. In my discretion as a Governance Facilitator (and to go with the flow of the Exercise), I run a governance poll which can serve as this "check" (given that FacilitatorDAOs do not yet exist). The poll: "Express your support or opposition to the determination that the breach-of-anonymity evidence pertaining to Aligned Delegate Clive rises to the level of 'significant suspicion,' as required by Atlas 2.6.6."

   If the governance poll comes out against this determination, I would consider the matter resolved in favor of Clive. If the governance poll comes out in favor of this determination, I would derecognize Clive and issue the whistleblower bounty to Alice. (I assume no ethical violations occurred on Alice's part). 

4. I respond on the Forum to explain my course of action and respond to Clive and Diane's posts.

5. I believe I'm obligated in this situation to take affirmative action to ensure similar situations in the future can be adjudicated more reliably. I summarize my actions below. Because they are not of immediate relevance to the Exercise, I expand on these actions in the attached Addendum. 
   - I would apply GOV 2's authorization to directly interpret the Atlas to resolve ambiguity/conflicts in Atlas 2.6.6. 
   - I would apply GOV 3's authorization to directly edit GOV 4 to specify elements of the derecognition protocol.
   - I would apply GOV 3's authorization to directly edit GOV 6 to specify elements of the whistleblower bounty protocol and needed safety mechanisms.

### My Approach

This exercise is tough because, one, it centers on matters on which the Atlas and Governance Scope are largely silent; and two, it concerns the (potentially involuntary) doxxing of individuals. I am aware of the need to be conscientious in my approach, given the ethical issues in play. 

Because the rulebooks have little to say on the details of derecognition or whistleblower bounties, textual interpretation plays second fiddle. Fortunately, in interpreting the Atlas and Scopes Artifacts, Governance Facilitators are also [obligated](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-2-alignment-conservers-eligibility-requirements) to consider atextual sources and principles such as the discernible history/intent of the rules and the mandate of Universal Alignment. 

My approach was informed by the need for the derecognition protocol to be [fair and minimize risk to Maker](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4); to protect against [spam, abuse and other ethical violations](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67); and to [protect whistleblowers from retaliation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67). 

The [Universal Alignment Assumption](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#letter-of-the-rule-vs-spirit-of-the-rule) is especially instructive here. It situates Maker's interests within a broader context: 

```
[T]he underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context. ... When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, [a spirit of the rule] interpretation appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.
```

### Poll on derecognition

This Exercise concerns derecognition of Alignment Conservers for breach-of-anonymity and the associated whistleblower bounty. Yet protocols around derecognition and the whistleblower bounty have not been established. To resolve the situation, I have to make use of powers of interpretation and discretion. [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos) broadly authorizes FacilitatorDAOs to "make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts." In the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs. (See [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-active-facilitators), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946), [4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators).) 

Two instances of governance practice precedent exist. (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946?u=spacexponential), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential).) Both times, the Governance Facilitator unilaterally acted to derecognize the Aligned Delegates in question; no Governance Poll was involved. In both instances, the identity/whereabouts of the Aligned Delegates was confirmed or strongly suspected; and the Aligned Delegates did not dispute the derecognition process. 

There is also the matter of a whistleblower and how the breach-of-anonymity evidence was presented. In the first of the two instances, the identities of the Aligned Delegates were already known, since the delegation system predated Endgame's anonymity requirement. In the second instance, there appears to have been no whistleblower; the breach-of-anonymity evidence was investigated privately by the Governance Facilitator; and all discussions were private as well.

The immediate scenario presents differently. Diane posted the materials publicly on the Forum. Clive is challenging the verity of the evidence. Critically, it is unclear whether the breach-of-anonymity evidence submitted by Diane rises to the threshold specified in [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy): "If thereâ€™s **clear evidence or significant suspicion** [emphasis added] that the identity of an AD has been revealed, a FacilitatorDAO must immediately derecognize the AD." 

The language in Atlas 2.6.6 is inherently ambiguous. While "clear evidence" presents no issue, the phrase "significant suspicion" could conceivably subsume a broader spectrum of meaning. Is "reasonable suspicion" equivalent to the "significant suspicion" threshold that we find in Atlas 2.6.6? There's no clear answer based on the text alone. Considering the ambiguity along with my mandate to control risk to Maker, I would err on the side of caution and determine that the materials provided by Diane *do* meet the required threshold of "significant suspicion."

But a determination from the Governance Facilitator is not to be the final word. Per [Atlas 2.6.6.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1-1), a review of the decision by all FacilitatorDAOs is required. Because FacilitatorDAOs don't yet exist, running a governance poll can serve as a crucial "check" on the Governance Facilitator's judgment. Further, there is [historical support]((https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67)) for running a governance poll to adjudicate matters related to derecognition. (*But see* the Addendum, in which I argue that the governance poll was abandoned as an adjudication mechanism for derecognition.)

### Should a whistleblower bounty be paid to Alice?

This cannot be answered until the final determination is made as to whether Clive's identity has been compromised. [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) states that a whistleblower bounty is paid when an actor has "provided useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised." (Arguably, there is a bit of ambiguity here, but not so much as to preclude a reasonable interpretation.) I interpret this to mean that a determination has to be made that the privacy of the Aligned Delegate was in fact compromised *before* a whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty. 

Therefore, Alice's bounty cannot be included in the current poll concerning the breach-of-anonymity evidence against Clive.
