# Poll Exercise 02

---

## Course of Action

### Summary

This is a tough one! (But fun to think about.) 

Protocols around derecognition and the whistleblower bounty have not been established. My aim is to resolve the immediate situation and to create clarity for similar situations in the future. (My course of action relating to the latter aim will be only summarized.) To do so, I will have to make use of powers to interpret and revise the Atlas/Scopes Artifacts. 

Assuming no concrete evidence of Clive's identity is provided, my course of action is as follows:

- I would not run a poll and would post on the Forum to set out the following
- To resolve ambiguity/conflicts in Atlas 2.6.6, I apply the power of direct interpretation: Among other issues, my interpretation clarifies the evidentiary showing required to trigger the derecognition protocol.
  - "any kind of real possibility" 2.6.6.1 and 2.6.6.1.1 >> 
    - revise so that must act is must act to investigate, not act to derecognize; differences in language
  - "clear evidence or significant suspicion" >> evidence of compromised identity rises above a reasonable doubt
  - bounty is only rewarded when one can determine that "the privacy of the AD was compromised"
    - this has not happened here; the materials do not rise to the level stated in the Atlas
    - bounty is only rewarded when the actor responsibly provided useful information - cannot be done publicly
      - rune's proposed revision and the necessary context around ethics, operational security
  
  - GOV 6 - mention of bounty mechanism
  
- I directly revise GOV 4 to specify - the argument for directly revising (vs running a poll) is that the revisions need to be made together to remain harmonious with one another
  - that the derecognition process will be initiated and settled privately between the Governance Facilitator and the Alignment Conserver in question
  - No governance poll will be used, because evidence cannot be posted or otherwise shared publicly. 
  - see contrasting elements between precedent and now:
    - what happens if actor disputes the evidence? 
      - a majority of the Governance Facilitators determines that the evidence rises above a reasonable doubt
      - if no dispute, then only one Governance Facilitator need make the call

- I propose a poll (or directly revise) GOV 6 to specify the conditions under which a whistleblower bounty is given 
  - must be done privately
  - if the breach of opsec was due to an affirmative act of the actor, then they are not eligible for the bounty
  - a finding can be made on whether identity was compromised, that rises beyond a reasonable doubt

- I respond on the Forum to summarize my course of action and to address Clive and Alice's posts. 
  - Re: Alice - I notify her that upon closer consideration, a poll will not be run. 
    - no formal protocol for the whistleblower bounty exists. 
    - the materials provided do not rise to the level specified in the Atlas
    - given that, the Facilitator cannot unilaterally derecognize
    - the question of whether a poll should be run
      - historical precedent supports this partly
      - but there is arguably ambiguity and conflicting language when interpreting the Atlas and Gov Scope and the requirement of universal alignment as a whole
      - the privacy and safety of Aligned Delegates should not be put at risk by having this be run through a governance poll
      - I am deleting the post 
  - Re: Clive - I notify him that AVCs are not authorized to resolve this situation, and that his comments are misaligned with the Atlas's requirement that ADs stay neutral, objective (fact finding focus, cite Atlas below) and do not have any strategic perspective of their own. 


### Applicable Authorizations

These are the specific elements supporting my course of action. They authorize the Governance Facilitator to act when there is a shortfall of some kind in the governance rulebooks. 

#### [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos)

FacilitatorDAOs are broadly authorized to "make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts." In the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs. (See [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-active-facilitators), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946), [4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators).)

#### [GOV 2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact)

Where, as here, the Scope Artifacts in themselves do not offer sufficient guidance to resolve a situation, GOV 2 generally [authorizes](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) Governance Facilitators to interpret the Atlas. Two paths are open to Governance Facilitators:

1) Per [GOV 2.2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-1): A majority of Governance Facilitators can trigger a Governance Poll to add Atlas interpretation precedent. 
2) Per [GOV 2.2.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2): Governance Facilitators may *directly add* Interpretation Precedent to the Atlas, bypassing the Governance Poll. 

[GOV 2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-1-principles-of-atlas-interpretation) provides that the choice between the two paths "depend[s] on the level of ambiguity." Unfortunately, this language is itself somewhat ambiguous, but as the Governance Facilitator, I am empowered to interpret it as follows: 

```
If a substantial amount of ambiguity is involved, thus requiring Governance Facilitators to create extrapolations of logic not reasonably grounded in existing language or the evident "spirit of the rules", then they should trigger a Governance Poll. 

But if the ambiguity is relatively insignificant such that broad extrapolations from the explicit language or evident spirit of the rules are unnecessary, then Governance Facilitators are authorized to directly add Interpretation Precedent to GOV 2.
```

*Note*: In a real-life situation, I would consider adding the above interpretation to [GOV 2.2.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2-1a), as I believe the ambiguity is relatively minor and clarification would be valuable.

#### [GOV 3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-scope-artifact-appeals)

Governance Facilitators are given broad authorization to directly review a Scope Artifact in a variety of scenarios, including when the Artifact fails to follow Atlas requirements, or its language is otherwise generally misaligned, biased, or conflicted. Broadly characterized, the list of situations where GOV 3 applies is clearly not meant to be exhaustive. 

[GOV 3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-1-1) allows Governance Facilitators, by consensus, to unilaterally and "directly edit a Scope Artifact to align its content with the Scope boundaries and other Atlas requirements such as neutrality." Governance practice [precedent](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential) exists for this sub-element.

Assuming a consenus or that I am the sole Governance FAcilitator 

### Context on derecognition

Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), a Facilitator DAO "must immediately derecognize" an Aligned Delegate "if thereâ€™s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed." As mentioned above, in the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs. Additionally, [GOV 4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#4-alignment-conservers) authorizes Governance Facilitators to "directly" act against Alignment Conservers who have breached the rules of the Atlas/Scope Artifacts, of which anonymity is one. 

**Atlas [2.4.4](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4) provides** that "GOV4 must specify the processes for derecognition so that they are fair and minimize risk for the Maker Ecosystem." But the Atlas/Scopes Artifacts have not yet specified a protocol for derecognizing Alignment Conservers whose anonymity has been, or is suspected of being, breached.

Two instances of governance practice precedent exist. (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946?u=spacexponential), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099?u=spacexponential).) Both times, the Governance Facilitator unilaterally acted to derecognize the Aligned Delegates in question; no Governance Poll was involved. In both instances, the identity/whereabouts of the Aligned Delegates was confirmed or strongly suspected; and the Aligned Delegates did not dispute or otherwise challenge the derecognition process. 

There is also the matter of the presence of a whistleblower and the presentation of the breach-of-anonymity evidence. In the first of the two instances, the identities of the Aligned Delegates were already known, as the delegation system predated Endgame's anonymity requirement. In the second instance, there was no whistleblower and the breach-of-anonymity evidence appears to have been produced/discussed privately with the Governance Facilitator.

The immediate scenario is different. Diane posted the materials publicly on the Forum. The materials produced by Diane constitute reasonable suspicion, but not hard evidence of Clive's true identity. (I interpret the Exercise prompt as meaning that Diane's materials fail the threshold specified in [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy): they do not rise to "clear evidence" or "significant suspicion" that Clive's identity has been revealed.) Clive is also challenging the verity of the evidence. 

Finally, the Exercise prompt starts things off with the Governance Facilitator (me) posting on the Forum to trigger a poll on derecognizing Clive. Though there is [historical support](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67) for using a governance poll in the derecognition process, this mechanism appears to have been supplanted in later versions of the rulebooks so as to free up Facilitators to act quickly and decisively. FacilitatorDAOs/Governance Facilitators are required to act "immediately" and "directly" to derecognize Aligned Delegates, without any mention of a subsequent Governance Poll that theoretically could decide *for* the Aligned Delegate. In particular, [Atlas 2.7.6.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-2) authorizes FacilitatorDAOs (Governance Facilitators in the Pregame) to "take **unilateral action** [emphasis added] based on the Alignment Artifacts in determining whether an Alignment Conserver ... must be derecognized."  (See also, [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1), [3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1-1).) 

That said, because Alice's publicly posted materials constitute only reasonable suspicion of breach of anonymity, the fairest way to proceed in a highly uncertain governance landscape may indeed be to run the poll. 

### Context on whistleblower bounty

GOV 6 - sufficient safety mechanisms around the whistleblower bounty

In both instances of governance practice precedent, no "whistleblower" was involved. This is a new issue.

### Course of Action

My general aim is to act as quickly as possible to address the scenario in front of me; per Atlas requirements, the possible breach of AD anonymity is a serious risk to Maker. But given the presence of shortfalls/ambiguity in the governance rulebooks, I also need to clarify governance practice by applying GOV 2 and GOV 3. (I assume no further evidence is presented on Clive's identity.) 

I would post a response on the Forum to address Clive's posts. First, I would point out that the lack of clarity around the Governance Scope regarding derecognition and the whistleblower bounty cannot be addressed by the AVCs. Governance Facilitators are explicitly authorized by the Atlas/Governance Scope to deal with such situations. Further, Clive's statement that he is happy to lead/support AVC is veering toward misalignment. Aligned Delegates are prohibited from having their own strategic perspective, which certainly includes such a self-serving endeavor as that proposed by Clive. Second, I would acknowldge briefly the problematic ambiguity and explain that the decision to run a Governance Poll is based on historical precedent, lack of clarity, and the desire to maintain optimal transparency in the immediate situation. But I would say going forwrd, given my changes and interpretations, no governance poll will be run as these determinations need to be done privately.

Third, I would post a response to Alice. Given the shortfall in guidance, I would say that I was pressed to interpret as authorized by the Atlas. And in this situation, no bounty will be paid out because the materials were shared publicly. This was not explicitly prohibited in the current Atlas, but this is a reasonable determination to make. 

I would then under GOV 2 and GOV 3
