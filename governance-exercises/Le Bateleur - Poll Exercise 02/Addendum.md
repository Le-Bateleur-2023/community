# Addendum

### Intro

This exercise concerns the (potentially involuntary) doxxing of individuals. I am aware of the need to be conscientious in my approach, given the serious ethical issues in play. 

Because the rulebooks have little to say on the details of derecognition or whistleblower bounties, textual interpretation plays second fiddle. Fortunately, in interpreting the Atlas and Scopes Artifacts, Governance Facilitators are also [obligated](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-2-alignment-conservers-eligibility-requirements) to consider atextual sources and principles such as the discernible history/intent of the rules and the mandate of Universal Alignment. 

My approach was informed by the need for the derecognition protocol to be [fair and minimize risk to Maker](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4); to protect against [spam, abuse and other ethical violations](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67); and to [protect whistleblowers from retaliation](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67). 

The [Universal Alignment Assumption](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#letter-of-the-rule-vs-spirit-of-the-rule) is especially instructive here. It situates Maker's interests within a broader context: 

```
[T]he underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a given context. ... When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, [a spirit of the rule] interpretation appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.
```

### Thoughts on why the derecognition process should be private/confidential

I believe Universal Alignment and the spirit of the rules require that the derecognition process - but for the final stage of announcing the formal determination - should be private. 

This relates to the question of whether it is appropriate to run a governance poll. I would not have run a poll in this Exercise for two reasons. First, there is no textual support for doing so. The second reason is about the ethical implications. Running a governance poll - if it is to be a substantive exercise of decisionmaking - would require that the breach-of-anonymity evidence, the associated investigation and the accompanying discussions amongst the various parties are public or otherwise accessible to Maker voters. Duking this out in a public arena risks all kinds of bad. 

Alignment Conservers ought to be protected from unjustified intrusions on their private lives. Here, Clive is protesting the verity of the materials provided by Diane. But in a *public* forum, how is an Aligned Delegate supposed to remain anonymous while defending themselves against the allegation that their true identity has been revealed? "That's not me, just take my word for it" would be the only option. But this can hardly be described as a meaningful basis for voters' decisionmaking. 

What is more troubling: let's say a bounty hunter pursues the identity of an Aligned Delegate to destabilize the DAO. The Governance Facilitator determines that the evidence of the bounty hunter does not rise to the required level to trigger derecognition. But now the evidence is available for all to see and parse in a public forum. The Aligned Delegate's privacy and opsec remain vulnerable, and the risks to them may not just be limited to the MakerDAO context.   

Further, the interests of the whistleblower and MakerDAO are also protected when the derecognition process does not take place in a public forum. This is especially true if the whistleblower is not of the "on-chain sleuth" variety, but is a trusted actor embedded in the ecosystem who has witnessed misaligned actions. If the whistleblower's identity is not known to the community, their "cover" is preserved. One's reputation in the community is an asset and having to jettison it dis-incentivizes whistleblowing, which goes against Maker's interests. 

To the argument that a whistleblower can go public while remaining anon: the very process of publicly providing evidence, or publicly substantiating *how* one knows what one knows, runs the risk of revealing certain aspects of one's position, relationships, etc., within the MakerDAO ecosystem. Finally, the likelihood of retaliation is greatly reduced if a whistleblower's identity is not known to the greater community. 

Finally, Rune's latest [proposed revision to Atlas 2.6.6](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp13-mip-amendment-subproposal/21305/3) includes a telling modification: "Half of the AD Buffer can be confiscated and used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor **responsibly** [emphasis added] provided useful information for determining that the operational security of an AD was compromised." The new emphasis on "responsibly provided" supports my thesis that the derecognition process (definitely the presentation of the whistleblower evidence) should largely be conducted privately. 

On balance, I'm leaning toward the conclusion that the governance poll was intentionally abandoned as a means to adjudicate derecognition. The derecognition process must be adjudicated with speed and finality to protect Maker's interests. But I believe it must take also largely unfold privately to balance the interests, ethical and otherwise, of all parties, including the Alignment Conserver and the whistleblower. I believe this is what Universal Alignment, and the spirit of the rules, require.

### Interpretations of the Atlas

To resolve the issues with Atlas 2.6.6, I would consider running a poll or directly adding Interpretation precedent to [Atlas 2.2.2.1A](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-2-1a), the gist of which follows:

##### Atlas 2.6.6

- "Clear evidence or significant suspicion" is interpreted as follows: the evidence must rise to a level of certainty or near-certainty that the Alignment Conserver's identity has been compromised. 
  - This evidentiary threshold is equivalent to the familiar reasonable-doubt standard of proof in criminal law: if the evidence establishes breach of anonymity beyond a reasonable doubt, then derecognition is triggered. 
  - A clear characterization of the evidentiary standard that relies on familiar legal standards guards against potential ethical abuse. 

- If the evidence rises to this required level, a FacilitatorDAO must immediately and unilaterally act to derecognize the Alignment Conserver. No governance poll is run. 
- If the evidence fails to rise to the required level, derecognition is not triggered and the matter is considered resolved.
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only after a formal determination to derecognize the Alignment Conserver has been made. 
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO of opsec breach.
- "Responsibly" is defined further in GOV6. 

##### Atlas 2.6.6.1

- Regarding the ambiguous requirement that "FacilitatorDAOs must err on the side of caution and act": "act" here means that the FacilitatorDAO, to whom allegations of opsec breach have been presented, must quickly initiate an investigation and issue a determination of whether derecognition is justified under Atlas 2.6.6. 
- Quickly is defined as within X days. 

*Note:* I realize further ambiguity remains with Atlas 2.6.6 (sub-elements), but I'm only addressing those elements immediately relevant to the Exercise at hand.

### Direct Revision of GOV 4 and GOV 6

This is the gist of the edits I would directly make to align the Governance Scope Artifact with the Atlas requirements. (Again, I focus only on the elements of immediate relevance to the Exercise.)

#### GOV 4

- The derecognition process consists of roughly 3 stages: initiation, investigation/discussion and determination. 
- With the exception of the final determination stage, the derecognition process must be conducted privately/confidentially between the responsible Facilitators, the Alignment Conserver and the whistleblower, if any. 
- Once the investigation/discussion has been concluded, the FacilitatorDAO is to formally announce the result. 

#### GOV 6

- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only after a formal determination to derecognize the Alignment Conserver has been made. 
- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted opsec-breach evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO. "Responsibly" means that:
  - The whistleblower is a mere conveyor of the opsec breach, and not its *cause*. In other words, an affirmative act of the whistleblower was *not* the proximate cause of the breach of the Alignment Conserver's identity or operational security.
  - The whistleblower submits the opsec-breach evidence in private to the responsible Facilitator.
  - In submitting evidence, the whistleblower takes all reasonable precautions to respect the fundamental privacy interests of the Alignment Conserver.
