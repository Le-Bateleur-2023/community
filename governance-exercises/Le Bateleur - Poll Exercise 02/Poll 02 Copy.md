# Poll: Determine if breach-of-anonymity evidence pertaining to Aligned Delegate Clive rises to the level specified in Atlas 2.6.6 - July 31, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 31 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

On [$date], a community member, Diane, posted on the [Forum]($link) alleging that Aligned Delegate Clive's identity had been discovered; the Forum post included materials to support this allegation. Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), the Governance Facilitator has determined the materials constitute "significant suspicion" that Clive's anonymity has been breached. [Atlas 2.6.6.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1-1) requires that FacilitatorDAOs review this decision before derecognition can be finalized. In lieu of a review by FacilitatorDAOs, the Governance Facilitator has determined that this poll should be run. 

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the determination that the materials shared on the Forum constitute "significant suspicion" that Aligned Delegate Clive's anonymity has been breached.

For more information, please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

* Aligned Delegate Clive will be derecognized, per Atlas 2.6.6.
* A Derecognition Notice will be issued publicly and recorded in the Governance Scope Alignment Artifact, per [GOV 4.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#4-1-alignment-conserver-derecognition).

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
