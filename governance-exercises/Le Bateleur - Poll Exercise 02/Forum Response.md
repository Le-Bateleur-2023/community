Per [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos), Governance Facilitators are granted the power to make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts. I have to make use of this authorization here. While [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) references a derecognition process, it is silent on the details, including the whistleblower bounty. 

Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), the Governance Facilitator must immediately derecognize an AD if "if thereâ€™s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed." The following two judgments are relatively easy for me to make. The materials posted by Diane do *not* constitute "clear evidence" that Clive's true identity has been revealed. On the other hand, the materials do invoke a reasonable or fair amount of suspicion of the breach of Clive's anonymity. The harder question is whether this is sufficient to meet the threshold of "significant suspicion" specified in the Atlas. (In the interim, no further evidence regarding Clive's identity has been produced.)

In my discretion, I have to make an individualized evaluation guided by the explicit terms and spirit of the rules. On balance, I believe the ambiguity in this situation should be resolved in favor of [minimizing risk for the Maker Ecosystem](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-4-4). Therefore, my determination is that the materials posted by Diane do constitute "significant suspicion" of the breach of Clive's anonymity. 

Before derecognition can be finalized, however, [Atlas 2.6.6.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1-1) requires that the decision of the Governance Facilitator be reviewed by all FacilitatorDAOs. At this point in the Pregame, FacilitatorDAOs are months away. But upholding the separation of powers envisioned in the Atlas/Scopes Artifacts is of utmost importance. In this instance, running a Governance Poll can serve as an alternative check on the power of the Governance Facilitators. 

Therefore, I will put up a poll next Monday, July 31 and ask voters to "Express your support or opposition to the determination that the breach-of-anonymity evidence pertaining to Aligned Delegate Clive rises to the level of 'significant suspicion,' as specified in Atlas 2.6.6." 

If the governance poll comes out *against* this determination, the matter will be resolved in favor of Clive. If the governance poll comes out *in favor of* this determination, Clive will be derecognized and a formal notice will be issued.

@Clive: Above, I have explained my reasoning in more detail to substantiate why a poll is warranted. Though I agree that the behavior of the relevant Scope provisions needs to be clarified, Governance Facilitators are empowered to adjudicate these matters and take discretionary actions based on their reading of the Atlas and Scopes Artifacts. 

As for your call-to-action of the AVCs, Clive: this is bordering on self-serving behavior. Aligned Delegates are obligated to remain neutral and objective. Per [Atlas 2.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-aligned-delegates-ads-gov6), ADs must not allow their power to become politicized and they must not have their own strategic perspectives. Any violation of this requirement is [misalignment](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-aligned-delegate-alignment-risk-mitigation) and will trigger [derecognition](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-5-1).

@Alice: The bounty will not be covered in this coming Monday's poll. Per [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy), a whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only *after* a formal determination is made that an Alignment Conserver's anonymity has been breached. Should Monday's poll determine that the materials provided rise to the level of "significant suspicion", thus triggering Clive's derecognition, I will contact you for next steps.
