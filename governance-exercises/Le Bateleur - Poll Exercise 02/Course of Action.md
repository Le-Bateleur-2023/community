# Poll Exercise 02

---

## Course of Action

### Summary

In the Exercise Prompt, I interpret "course of action" to encompass the immediate steps of responding to the Forum thread and other pre-drafting needs.

Assuming no further evidence concerning Clive's identity is provided, my course of action is as follows:

1. Given my mandate to minimize risk to Maker and guard against misalignment threats, I interpret Diane's materials as rising to the level of "significant suspicion" specified in Atlas 2.6.6.

2. Before derecognition can be finalized, however, the Atlas requires a "check" on my decision in the form of a review from FacilitatorDAOs. FacilitatorDAOs do not yet exist. So, in my discretion as a Governance Facilitator (and to go with the flow of the Exercise), I run a governance poll which can serve as this "check." The poll: "Express your support or opposition to the determination that the breach-of-anonymity evidence pertaining to Aligned Delegate Clive rises to the level of 'significant suspicion,' as specified in Atlas 2.6.6."

   If the governance poll comes out against this determination, I would consider the matter resolved in favor of Clive. If the governance poll comes out in favor of this determination, I would derecognize Clive.

3. I respond on the Forum to explain my course of action and respond to Clive and Diane's posts.

### Poll on derecognition

This Exercise concerns derecognition of Alignment Conservers for breach-of-anonymity and the associated whistleblower bounty. But protocols around derecognition and the whistleblower bounty have not yet been established. To resolve the situation, I have to make use of powers of interpretation and discretion. [GOV 2.7.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-7-6-decision-making-powers-of-facilitatordaos) authorizes FacilitatorDAOs to "make interpretations and take discretionary decisions based on the language of the Alignment Artifacts." In the Pregame, Governance Facilitators act in the place of FacilitatorDAOs. (See [1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-facilitatordaos-and-facilitators), [2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#7-1-active-facilitators), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946).) 

Two instances of governance practice precedent exist. (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099).) Both times, the Governance Facilitator unilaterally acted to derecognize the Aligned Delegates in question; no Governance Poll was involved. In both instances, the identity/whereabouts of the Aligned Delegates was confirmed or strongly suspected; and the Aligned Delegates did not dispute the derecognition process. 

There is also the matter of a whistleblower and how the breach-of-anonymity evidence was presented. In the first of the two instances, the identities of the Aligned Delegates were already known, since the delegation system predated Endgame's anonymity requirement. In the second instance, there appears to have been no whistleblower; and the breach-of-anonymity evidence was investigated privately by the Governance Facilitator.

The immediate scenario presents differently. Diane posted the materials publicly on the Forum. Clive is challenging the verity of the evidence. Critically, it is unclear whether the breach-of-anonymity evidence submitted by Diane rises to the threshold specified in [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy): "If thereâ€™s **clear evidence or significant suspicion** [emphasis added] that the identity of an AD has been revealed, a FacilitatorDAO must immediately derecognize the AD." 

The language in Atlas 2.6.6 is ambiguous. While "clear evidence" presents no issue, the phrase "significant suspicion" presents a gray area. Is "reasonable suspicion" equivalent to the "significant suspicion" threshold that we find in Atlas 2.6.6? There's no clear answer based on the text alone. But I am also aware of my [mandate](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP999#2-4-2-alignment-conservers-eligibility-requirements) to minimize risk to Maker and guard against misalignment threats. This is a close call, especially given the ambiguity in Atlas 2.6.6. I am compelled in this instance to err on the side of caution and determine that the materials provided by Diane *do* meet the specified threshold of "significant suspicion."

But a determination from the Governance Facilitator is not to be the final word. Per [Atlas 2.6.6.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-1-1), a review of the decision by all FacilitatorDAOs is required. Because FacilitatorDAOs don't yet exist, running a governance poll can serve as a crucial "check" on the Governance Facilitator's power. There is also (outdated) [historical support](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip102c2-sp2-mip-amendment-subproposals/20016/19#h-1011-constitutional-boundaries-of-the-arbitration-scope-framework-67) for using a governance poll to adjudicate derecognition matters. (The former Maker Constitution, 10.11.3.4, states, "During the Pregame, all actions of derecognition must be decided through a MKR governance poll...")

### Should a whistleblower bounty be paid to Alice?

This cannot be answered until the final determination is made as to whether Clive's identity has been compromised. [Atlas 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) states that a whistleblower bounty is paid when an actor has "provided useful information for determining that the privacy of an AD was compromised." (Arguably, there is a bit of ambiguity here, but not so much as to preclude a reasonable interpretation.) I interpret this to mean that a determination has to be made that the privacy of the Aligned Delegate was in fact compromised *before* a whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty. 

Therefore, Alice's bounty cannot be included in the coming Monday's poll concerning the breach-of-anonymity evidence against Clive. Should that poll determine the materials provided rise to the level of "significant suspicion", thus triggering Clive's derecognition, I would then do the necessary follow up with Alice on the bounty.

### *Epilogue*

Had I started from ground zero in the Exercise, I would not have run a poll. But I think Atlas 2.6.6.1.1 provides fairly viable support for running one. 

Given my mandate as Governance Facilitator, I believe this situation would also call for follow-up. I would consider taking proactive steps to resolve the ambiguity in the current rules, so that similar situations in the future can be more reliably adjudicated in an aligned manner. The ethical concerns in play are a huge factor in my thinking.

[GOV 2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-atlas-immutable-alignment-artifact) generally authorizes Governance Facilitators to interpret the Atlas when there is a shortfall in the Scope Artifacts. It is arguably applicable here. Per [GOV 2.2.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#2-2-1), I might consider running a poll proposing Atlas Interpretation precedent that clarifies Atlas 2.6.6 language, including the evidentiary standard and when the bounty is claimable. 

[GOV 3.1.1.1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#3-1-1-1) allows Governance Facilitators, by consensus, to "directly edit a Scope Artifact to align its content with the Scope boundaries and other Atlas requirements such as neutrality." (Governance practice [precedent](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/notice-aligned-delegate-derecognition-and-avc-member-warning/21099) exists for this sub-element.) I would consider, for instance, directly editing GOV 6 to specify ethical guardrails around the whistleblower bounty:

- A whistleblower is eligible to receive a bounty only if they responsibly submitted opsec-breach evidence/information to the FacilitatorDAO. 
- "Responsibly" means that the whistleblower is a mere conveyor of the opsec breach, and not its *cause*. In other words, an affirmative act of the whistleblower was *not* the proximate cause of the breach of the Alignment Conserver's identity or operational security.

Running a [GOV 12](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#12-1-bootstrapping-governance-votes) governance poll is also an option. However, it may be a stretch to say that the issue presented here is due to an "unintended consequence or mistake" in the rulebooks "causing Maker Governance to function incorrectly". Simply, the protocols around derecognition and bounties haven't been fleshed out. Also, as mentioned above, the situation presents highly sensitive ethical issues that, on balance, should arguably be a commitment on the part of Maker, rather than a matter of choice for voters.
