# Poll Assignment 01

### Course of Action

---

In the Exercise Prompt, I interpret "course of action" to encompass the immediate steps of responding to the Forum thread and other pre-drafting needs. 

#### I. Post a Forum Reply

As Governance Facilitator, my mandate includes: 

i) ensuring clarity and transparency around the process that led to the poll being submitted to governance; and

ii) ensuring voters have access to sufficient information to make an informed vote. 

If polled in its current state, the proposal and accompanying Reply on the Forum would fall short of both standards. Therefore, I would first post a Forum response to seek clarity on a number of points. 

##### Ensure Alice and Faraz are on the same page regarding the adjustment of Spork D3M `ttl` parameter.

If polled in its current state, there would be insufficient clarity and transparency around the process that led to the poll being submitted to governance. 

In the originating post, Alice proposes that the Spork Protocol D3M's Debt Ceiling and Target Available Debt parameters be adjusted. Alice notes that "total throughput may remain the same." 

In reply, Faraz relays the advisory teams' agreement with increasing these aforementioned parameters. He also proposes a specific adjustment to the Debt Increase Cooldown parameter (which I assume is the same as the 'Ceiling Increase Cooldown' `ttl` parameter).

As her post did indicate that total minting throughput should remain the same, Alice would likely agree with this proposed adjustment of the `ttl` parameter. Nevertheless, I would confirm Alice's agreement in my Forum response. 

##### Request Faraz/Advisors provide an updated risk assessment of ABC token.

I believe the current proposal provides an insufficient basis on which Maker Governance may make an informed decision on the onboarding of ABC token. 

As an initial point: neither Alice's originating post nor Faraz's Reply contains any rationale for onboarding ABC token to Spork Protocol specifically. (Historically, Spark Protocol proposals for onboarding new collateral have provided such a rationale for the benefit of Maker Governance (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-of-gno-to-spark/20831?u=le_bateleur), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-of-gno-to-spark/20831/9?u=le_bateleur), [3](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/2023-05-24-spark-protocol-updates/20958/2?u=le_bateleur)).) 

In light of my mandate as a Governance Facilitator, I would prefer to err on the side of caution here and request an updated risk assessment from Faraz/advisors for a number of reasons. (Spark Protocol proposals seeking to onboard tokens that were approved by Maker in the past nevertheless have provided updated risk assessments (See [1](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-of-gno-to-spark/20831/9?u=le_bateleur), [2](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/2023-05-24-spark-protocol-updates/20958/2?u=le_bateleur) ).) 

First, the Exercise Prompt states that ABC token was previously onboarded to Maker Core; however, there is no indication as to when precisely this occurred. Given the indeterminate date of the original assessment, Faraz's assurance that the advisory teams' analysis "has not changed appreciably" is arguably vague and insufficient. Voters would be well within reason to desire a current assessment of relevant risk factors.

Second, the Spork market is distinct from Maker. That ABC token was both onboarded and offboarded from Maker Core due to certain factors (in the indeterminate past) does not necessarily have a direct, one-to-one relevance for Spork. Onboarding a new collateral to Spork adds unique risk, complexity and cost - including, at minimum, the cost of governance and maintaining price feeds. Arguably, an informed decision from Maker voters requires a Spork Protocol-specific risk assessment.

Third, Faraz states that ABC token was offboarded from Maker Core "due to limited usage" and not concerns around liquidity. Yet Maker's offboarding of ABC token due to limited usage arguably throws up concerns, notwithstanding the fact that the Spork market is distinct. A few historical examples expand on my position.

- [As seen here](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/why-does-makerdao-offboard-collateral-that-doesnt-meet-its-net-surplus-requirement/20790/4?u=le_bateleur), Maker Core has offboarded collaterals for low demand/usage since they "are unprofitable after accounting for maintenance and opportunity cost, but also not scalable due to low market liquidity and demand." 
- Collaterals evincing relatively high on-chain liquidity have nevertheless been offboarded from Maker due to low demand and negative cash flow, as seen in this [instance](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-offboard-uni-univ2daieth-univ2wbtceth-univ2unieth-and-univ2wbtcdai/15160). 
- A collateral with "suboptimal on-chain liquidity" was nevertheless [recommended](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-of-gno-to-spark/20831/9?u=le_bateleur) for onboarding to Spark Protocol by Maker's risk assessment team due to other ameliorating factors. 

Thus, an updated, Spork Protocol-specific risk assessment would provide finer resolution for Maker voters into the often multi-faceted question of risk. 

Finally, per the [Poll Principles](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/processes/poll-principles.md) document, outside observers or "[u]sers of the protocol ... cannot be expected to have the same level of context and knowledge about the inner workings of the Maker protocol as regular voters or delegates." This is another reason why I am concerned about Faraz's Forum reply in which he stated, "*as governance is aware* [emphasis added], ABC was offboarded from Core purely due to limited usage rather than as a result of concern around risk." Without an updated, Spork Protocol-specific risk assessment, I fear we would not be inclusive of these additional stakeholders who cannot be expected to have a comparable command of Maker Core's motivation in offboarding ABC token.  

##### Request Faraz/Advisors confirm their agreement with increasing the Spork Deposit Rate per Alice's proposal.

If polled in its current state, there would be insufficient clarity and transparency around the process that led to the poll being submitted to governance. Faraz neglected to address Alice's proposal to increase Spork's DAI deposit rate. It is necessary that the Facilitator and advisory teams confirm all proposed changes are reasonable and suitable for implementation on Spork. 

##### Request confirmation of the organizing of proposals into 3 separate polls. 

To ensure greater clarity and transparency around the pre-Poll process, I would confirm the parties' agreement with breaking out the proposals into three polls for the following Monday. I recommend this organization so that each Poll is focused on a distinct sub-set of the proposals.

Poll 1: Spork D3M parameter adjustments

Poll 2: Increase Spork DAI Deposit Rate

Poll 3 (assuming Faraz/advisors provide an updated risk assessment): Onboard ABC token to Spork

#### II. Prepare three (3) separate governance polls for the following Monday

Assuming the parties promptly address/confirm all foregoing points, I would then post a final follow-up on the Forum to signal that the polls will proceed as set out above. 

Then, I would prepare three (3) separate polls to be posted on the voting portal the following Monday, July 24. 

Given the time-sensitive nature of Alice's proposal, there is a specific need to use the Weekly Governance Cycle. The governance polls are fully justified per [MIP16](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16#component-summary):

> The Weekly Governance Cycle is used explicitly for recurring operational decisions that require quicker action than the Monthly Governance Cycle (defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51)). For example, the Weekly Cycle will be used to modify rates and debt ceilings for the collateral types in the Maker collateral portfolio.
>
> It is important to note that due to the frequency of such changes, the Weekly Cycle is not suitable for long term or substantial decisions but is ideal for specific time-sensitive decisions that do not require an Emergency vote.
>
> ... [T]he use of the weekly cycle as defined in this MIP should only occur where there is a specific need to use the weekly cycle as opposed to the monthly cycle.

Per [MIP16c3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16#MIP16c3), I assume there is consensus among the Governance Facilitators so that I may make use of the weekly cycle as opposed to the monthly cycle. 

I also assume that the number of polls to be released for the following Monday is not prohibitively large. If this were the case, I might at least consider aggregating the Spork proposals into a single/smaller number of polls. (See [here](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/iam-dc-parameters-2-lrc-a-bat-a-bal-a-mana-a-zrx-a-knc-a-renbtc-a/6431/2?u=le_bateleur).) 

*Note:* In the attached Polls, I have included several empty/placeholder links; for instance, I include a placeholder link so that voters can glean additional information on hypothetical Ecosystem Actor, Alice.
