Hi @Alice, @Faraz & @Bob

I'd like to ensure that Maker governance has access to sufficient information to make an informed vote, and that there is optimal clarity and transparency around the polling process generally. 

First: @Alice, I want to confirm that you are aware of, and in agreement with, Faraz/advisors' proposal to adjust the Spork D3M Debt Increase Cooldown (`ttl`) parameter to 86,400 seconds (24 hours).

Second:  @Faraz, I want to request on behalf of voters an updated risk assessment of ABC token. Although ABC was previously onboarded to Maker Core, I believe voters will be best positioned to make an informed vote given an updated assessment of the risk factors pertinent to the Spork market specifically. Further, that Maker core offboarded ABC token due to "limited usage" may present some concern to voters, such that additional context from the advisory teams would be advisable. Please refer to this recent example of an [updated risk assessment](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/onboarding-of-gno-to-spark/20831/9?u=le_bateleur). 

Third: @Faraz, I want to confirm that you and the advisory teams are in agreement with @Alice's proposal to increase the Spork DAI deposit rate from 2% to 2.5%.

Fourth: @Faraz and @Alice, assuming the foregoing points are promptly confirmed/addressed, I would like to break out the proposals into 3 separate polls for this following Monday. Please let me know if you have any objections as to this last point.  

Poll 1: Spork D3M parameter adjustments

Poll 2: Increase Spork DAI Deposit Rate

Poll 3 (assuming Faraz/advisors provide an updated risk assessment): Onboard ABC token to Spork

Thanks for addressing all points, @Alice & @Faraz.

As set out above, the three polls will go live on the voting portal this following Monday, July 24.
