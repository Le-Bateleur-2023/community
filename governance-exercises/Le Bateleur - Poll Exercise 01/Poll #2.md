# Poll: Increase Spork Protocol DAI Deposit Rate to 2.5% - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spork Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

Spork Protocol is seeing significant growth and seeks to capitalize on this momentum by further increasing deposit demand. The Stability Scope Facilitators and Ecosystem Actor [Alice]($link) have proposed increasing the Spork Protocol DAI Deposit Rate. 

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition to the following proposal:

* Increase Spork Protocol DAI Deposit Rate from 2% to 2.5%.

Please review the discussion [thread]($discussion_link) to help inform your position before voting.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This change will be included in an upcoming Executive Vote.
* It is expected that this Executive Vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the Executive Vote passes, then these changes will become active in the Maker Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
