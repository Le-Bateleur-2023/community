# Poll: Onboard ABC to Spork Protocol - July 24, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spork Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, July 24 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

This poll allows the MakerDAO governance community to signal their support or opposition to adding ABC to Spork Protocol with the parameters below:

### Spork Parameters 

* Token: $short-token
* Token Address: $token-address
* Oracle: $oracle
* Oracle Provider: $oracle-provider
* Borrow Enabled: $YesNo

Please review the proposal [thread]($proposal_thread) for more information about this proposed onboarding.

ABC token was previously onboarded to Maker Core; you can find the original risk assessment [here]($link). The Stability Scope advisory teams have prepared an updated risk assessment which can be found [here]($risk-thread). 

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**

* ABC will be onboarded to Spork Protocol in an upcoming executive vote.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then these changes will become active in Spork Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://manual.makerdao.com/parameter-index/core/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
