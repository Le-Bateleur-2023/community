# Poll Exercise 03

---

## Course of Action

In the Exercise Prompt, I interpret "course of action" to encompass the immediate steps of responding to the Forum thread and other pre-drafting needs.

As Governance Facilitator, my mandate includes:

i) ensuring clarity and transparency around the process that led to the poll being submitted to governance; and

ii) ensuring voters have access to sufficient information to make an informed vote.

If polled in its current state, Emilia's proposal and Faraz's Reply on the Forum would fall short of both standards. Therefore, I would not run a governance poll. 

*Note*: given the time constraints to complete this exercise, I will address at a high level my approach; briefly summarize my Forum responses; and defer the actual drafting of the Forum response. (I have confirmed this is ok with LFW.)

### Poll Timeline

Emilia posted on Friday and stated "the poll should take place on Monday." Given the ambiguity in the Exercise prompt, I'll quickly review the various possibilities.

#### *If Emilia means to request a standard weekly poll*   

This is an unworkable turnaround time for a standard weekly poll. All needed information for a standard poll should be available by Thursday at the latest, if it is to run the following Monday. This gives the Governance Facilitator sufficient time to address all concerns, such as locating missing context; write the poll; and review and submit the poll on Friday. Rushing this process endangers both aspects of my mandate as a Governance Facilitator. (See [here](https://discord.com/channels/893112320329396265/899667119426371625/1111687437547212851).)

Further, the plain text of [MIP16](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16#motivation) raises the question of whether this ought to be a weekly poll at all. (The Exercise prompt is necessarily ambiguous as it does not flesh out the text of the proposed Standing Order.)

> The Weekly Governance Cycle is used explicitly for **recurring operational decisions** [emphasis added] that require quicker action than the Monthly Governance Cycle ... .  For example, the Weekly Cycle will be used to modify rates and debt ceilings for the collateral types in the Maker collateral portfolio.
>
> It is important to note that due to the frequency of such changes, the Weekly Cycle is not suitable for long term or substantial decisions but is ideal for specific time-sensitive decisions that do not require an Emergency vote. 

From the prompt, I can glean only that the proposed standing order has to do with the RWA vault's quarterly revenue return. It's questionable whether this counts as the kind of time sensitive and recurring/standardized operational decision envisioned in MIP16.   

#### *If Emilia means to request a non-standard weekly poll* 

There is no explicit indication that Emilia intended to request a non-standard weekly poll. Assuming she did so intend, the required justification is neither given nor discernible from her post. 

Per MIP16:

> [T]he use of non-standard weekly governance polls will be limited to situations where the [monthly] governance cycle is determined to operate too slowly to be usable. ... To create a non-standard weekly poll requires an urgent and apparent reason from a timing perspective to justify it. 

Per [MIP16c1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16#MIP16c1), Emilia is not eligible in any event to make use of this type of poll: the use of non-standard weekly polls is limited to Facilitators. 

#### *If Emilia means to initiate a poll in support of an out-of-schedule MIP24 executive vote*

[MIP24](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24) defines Maker's emergency voting system, pursuant to which any community member may initiate an emergency executive vote. MIP24 is inapplicable in this situation. Emilia's post does not present an "emergency situation" or an "urgent situation", as defined in [MIP24c1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24#MIP24c1).

Granted, Emilia did not explicitly request an out-of-schedule Executive Vote under MIP24. But accounting for the ambiguity in the Exercise prompt, it is possible she was incorrectly trying to invoke one. After all, Emilia was clearly seeking an accelerated timeline. Further, Emilia's proposal combined: 1) the purported invalidation of the current ALM Standing Order (high stakes!), and 2) a Forum poll which may have been an attempted Signal Request. Note that [MIP24c3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24#MIP24c3) provides the option of creating a signal request thread or governance poll to initiate the emergency response process.

(Generally, Signal Requests are [no longer permitted](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c2SP27#amended-mips-and-components), unless specifically triggered and required by an existing MIP, such as MIP24.)

### Problems with the Standing Orders (aka Instruction Sets)

I assume the Exercises' Standing Orders are equivalent to the "Instruction Sets" of current RWA structures. (See [1](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-andromeda-risk-legal-assessment/20969#instruction-sets-9), [2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/clydesdale-vault-hq/17923#clydesdale-instruction-sets-4).) For the purpose of the Exercise, I use [Monetalis Clydesdale](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip65-clydesdale-governance-framework-setup/16565)'s governance framework as a reference point in terms of best practices/prerequisites concerning a Standing Order/Instruction Set:

> One can somewhat see the Instructions coming as a Governance Poll outcome from Maker as the “code” and the trust/trustee/3rd parties as the “machine” that safely executes the code and puts relevant data back to Maker. ...**These instruction sets are set out to be as detailed as possible** - including **clear specification** of checks and validations required along the way.
>
> Maker can structure instruction sets in any manner it prefers and submit via Governance Poll to the Trust - and given it is legal and possible - it will execute. ...
>
> As a safety measure we have also developed a library of key instruction sets that address key situations and can be put up as Governance Polls, **that we know are appropriately designed and confirmed executables.** This way most eventualities are planned for and can be acted upon confidently and speedily by Maker. ...
>
> **Trustee has no discretion for executions outside of Governance Poll approved instruction sets.** [emphasis added]

There are three problems related to the Standing Orders in the Exercise Prompt, which run counter to both aspects of my mandate as a Governance Facilitator.

First, the proposed Standing Order does not offer voters enough information to make an informed decision; this is due to the ambiguities in the proposed Standing Order, which I assume are non-trivial. If the Standing Order/Instruction Set is to be akin to safely executable code, it cannot be ambiguous without presenting significant risk to Maker. 

For the Clydesdale RWA structure, a library of standing orders/instruction sets was proactively developed and validated by the pertinent Maker ecosystem actors prior to any immediate need. In the immediate situation, we are apparently missing the expert input/assessment of such ecosystem actors, including the Strategic Finance Core Unit. (SFCU's [mandate](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP55c3SP12#sentence-summary) is the monitoring of RWA vaults and includes the review of legal structures, resolutions, wordings and agreements.) From the Exercise prompt, I assume this oversight may be due to Emilia's mistaken belief that her conversations with "large MKR governance holders" sufficed, without further ado, to bring the proposal forward. (See [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-to-increase-debt-ceiling-for-mip65-by-750m-to-1250m/20060#makerdao-resolution-instruction-sets-12) for another pertinent Clydesdale precedent, announcing that a proposed instruction set will be shared along *with* an "assessment by a relevant member with legal credentials in the Maker Community.")

Second, the proposal purports to unilaterally invalidate the current Standing Order concerning ALM transfers. Curiously, the proposed Standing Order concerns a different topic entirely (revenue return) than the one Emilia purports to invalidate. Emilia's attempted unilateral invalidation of a current Standing Order (and one involving Maker's first line of defense of the peg, no less) crosses the line that is forbidden to the Trustee - an "execution outside of a Governance approved instruction set." It is also arguably a violation of the [Stability Scope provision](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#5-1-arrangers) prohibiting Arrangers from "operat[ing] or influenc[ing] the arranged legal and operational structure’s asset operations in a way that can cause any significant harm or losses to Dai’s stability." Even *if* the replacement ALM order were already drafted and ready to be presented, nevertheless, the current Standing Order cannot be unilaterally done away with. Only an official act of Maker Governance can alter or replace Standing Orders. 

Third, the proposed Standing Order concerns revenue return and thus, the technical means to achieve this is an important question for Maker governance. But Emilia's Forum post offers scant insight into the technical details and the few words she does offer are vague. Which conduit contract, for instance? (See [here](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/coinbase-custody-legal-assessment/20384/2) for an example of why it is important to be clear on this point.) 

Fourth, the title of Emilia's post ("Standing Order Change") is misleading and likely to cause confusion. This is because two standing orders are implicated in her post. Though only one is being currently proposed for a Governance poll, the other one is the subject of a Forum poll. The presence of the Forum poll may easily mislead readers to believe that the latter standing order is referenced in the title. 

### Forum Polling

First, Emilia's deployment of a Forum poll under these circumstances is confusing. It's unclear whether she deployed a Forum poll to take on the guise of a MIP24 Signal Request. (See discussion above.) 

The structure/content of the poll also fails on a few fronts. There's no introduction to, or summary of, the essential context that participants would need prior to meaningful participation in the poll. There's no Abstain option, which can be a valuable signal for voters who wish to express ambivalence or proactively protest. In each poll option, two different values/scenarios are combined, making any "signal" impossible to discern. The fourth poll option of ''Something Else" is similarly useless. Finally, the title of Emilia's post, "Standing Order Change", is likely to cause significant misunderstanding: voters may believe that the poll (on the logic of the future ALM order) represents the "standing order change" referenced in the title. 

The biggest problem: Emilia's post may lead the community to believe that the poll outcomes have a determinative say in the logic of the replacement ALM order. If Emilia wishes to gauge community sentiment and is yet aware of her mandate as an Arranger, then she would have to acknowledge that deciding the logic of the ALM transfer orders ultimately lies within the purview of domain experts. 

### Re: Faraz's Reply

Faraz's reply doesn't help matters. There is his use of the singular "this", in conjunction with the plural "changes". Is this a typo? It's not clear what he's approving, either. There are two Standing Orders at issue. The first is the proposed Order relating to revenue return, which has obvious ambiguities. The second is the current Order relating to ALM transfers which Emilia improperly "invalidated" in her Forum post. It is possible that Faraz, in issuing such a confusing reply and approving either/both Order(s), has not fulfilled his mandate as a Facilitator. 

Finally: to authorize an item for a poll, the Facilitator and advisory teams must explicitly confirm the proposed change is reasonable and suitable for implementation. Faraz's comment about the ALM structure adds to the mixed signals. This would seem to indicate that he is *not* authorizing a poll for the ALM-related order, because the advisory teams' evaluation on that item is forthcoming.

### Forum Response, in Brief  

To @Emilia:

- I would post a public reply on Emilia's Forum thread.
- I would explain why a standard governance poll cannot be run in this instance and give her the above-mentioned timeline for future reference (all needed information by Thursday, etc.). 
- I would not mention the non-standard poll or the MIP24 emergency vote unless Emilia brought them up.
- I would point out, at a high level only, the shortfalls in her Post and Forum Poll. (I am aware that Faraz has the more direct working relationship and scope of authority/review.) I would emphasize my mandate as a Governance Facilitator in explaining the shortfalls.  

To @Faraz:

- I would ping him privately. 
- I would let him know that the poll would not be posted that same day, for the reasons set out above.
- To Faraz, I would be more specific about my concerns about Emilia's post. I would also respectfully express my concerns about Faraz's confusing "authorization", as set out above.
- I would respectfully suggest that Faraz have a private discussion with Emilia, clarifying the mandate of an Arranger, etc. The question of how an Arranger is evaluated and possibly disciplined is covered in a narrow way in this [Stability Scope provision](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP104#5-1-4-arranger-reports-and-stress-tests), which also gives Faraz (as Stability Scope Facilitator) a certain authority.
- I would also suggest that Faraz actively coordinate with the pertinent ecosystem actors (SFCU, Protector Advisors, etc.) who can provide needed input when Emilia/MagicRWA return to the Forum.
