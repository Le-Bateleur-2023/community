# Interpretation Exercise 01

---

## Scenarios

A two-prong showing must be made before GOV 12 can facially apply to a situation. First, an "unintended consequence or mistake in the Atlas/Scope Artifacts" must be alleged. Second, it must be alleged that the unintended consequence or mistake has "caus[ed] Maker Governance to function incorrectly."

### Scenario A - Aligned Delegates are not being compensated due to a clear typo elsewhere in the Governance Scope.

Yes, I would allow a vote to take place. A clear typo is evidently a mistake or unintended consequence of the kind that accords with the justified intent of GOV 12. It is a mistake that is easily identified, even without the thorny challenges around ascertaining intent. That this oversight has directly caused Maker Governance to function incorrectly cannot be reasonably disputed, given the central and heavily-documented role of Aligned Delegates in Endgame governance.

I would post on the Forum to signal the imminent governance polls, citing GOV 12 as the relevant authority. In the Forum post, I would point out the clear typo and the unintended consequence of Aligned Delegates not being compensated. I would also emphasize that the continued compensation of Aligned Delegates, thus enabling continuity of their service, is a presupposition to the integrity of Maker governance. 

I would then prepare two (2) separate polls as follows:

**Poll 1** - "Signal your support or opposition to distribute compensation incorrectly withheld from Aligned Delegates due to a clear typo." 

Plurality poll; binary vote; and active for 3 days.

I would link to GOV 12 (as the authority for the poll) and the Forum thread. For the convenience of voters, I would quote in the Poll copy the typo preventing Aligned Delegates from being compensated. Finally, I would link to the accompanying Poll #2. 

**Poll 2** - "Governance Scope Bootstrapping Edits"

"Signal your support or opposition to revising the Governance Scope to correct a typo preventing Aligned Delegates from being compensated." 

Plurality poll; binary vote; and active for 3 days. 

I would link to GOV 12 (as the authority for the poll); the Forum thread; and the Amendment Pull Request. Finally, I would link to the accompanying Poll #1.

### Scenario B - A large token holder wants to add logic to the Stability Scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle.

No, I would not allow a vote to take place. No "unintended consequence or mistake in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts" is alleged or discernible. Even assuming this first-prong showing, there is no indication that a supposed mistake is *causing* Governance to function incorrectly, apart from the vague claim that the change is required to "prevent the DAO losing significant value". The naked desire to add logic more quickly than is possible using the monthly cycle is facially irrelevant to the determination of whether GOV 12 is applicable. 

### Scenario C - An anonymous account wants to add logic to the Stability Scope more quickly than is possible using the monthly governance cycle.

No, I would not allow a vote to take place. No "unintended consequence or mistake in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts" is alleged or discernible. Even assuming this first-prong showing, there is no indication that a supposed mistake is *causing* Governance to function incorrectly, apart from the vague claim that the change is required to "prevent the DAO losing significant value". The naked desire to add logic more quickly than is possible using the monthly cycle is facially irrelevant to the determination of whether GOV 12 is applicable. 

### Scenario D - As a consequence of a significant reduction in Aligned Delegate pay, all Aligned Delegates step down from the position.

No, I would not allow a vote to take place. By its explicit terms, [GOV 6.3](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#6-3-prime-delegate-and-reserve-delegate-slots) allows for Aligned Delegate compensation to be significantly reduced. It is unreasonable to suppose that the drafter did not foresee the contingency of Aligned Delegates reacting unfavorably to pay reductions, all the way up to resigning the position. In fact, the Atlas' [inclusion](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-3-1-1) of general restrictions and a one-month buffer period when adjusting Aligned Delegate compensation indicates the drafter accounted for this contingency of unfavorable reactions.

In any event, no "unintended consequence or mistake in the Atlas and Scope Artifacts" is alleged or discernible. Absent this first-prong showing, it is not possible to meet the second-prong showing - namely, that such unintended consequence or mistake has *caused* Maker Governance to function incorrectly.

Finally, per GOV 6.3, the Governance Facilitators are already authorized to trigger a weekly governance poll to change the number of Prime/Reserve Delegate slots and adjust the compensation level. A remedial path already exists via a governance poll. This is another reason why GOV 12 should not be considered in this scenario.
