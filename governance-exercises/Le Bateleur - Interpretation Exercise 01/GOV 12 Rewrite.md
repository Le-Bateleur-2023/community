# Interpretation Exercise 01

## Proposed Rewrite of GOV 12

To redress the aforementioned concerns, I would rewrite GOV 12 to 

- include more explicit, clear language restricting its application;
- require endorsements from rotating ecosystem actors to provide checks/balances against the concentration of power; and
- carve out limited exceptions for clear mistakes and Launch Project-related needs (the latter being a one-time [exception](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP108#9-launch-project) to the Atlas' requirement of maximum transparency). 

I am bending the rules of the universe a bit. First, my rewrite assumes that associated provisions in the rulebooks (i.e., [Atlas 2.12)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-12-scope-bootstrapping-gov12) would have to be interpreted or re-written so as to be reconciled with the revised GOV 12. The revised GOV 12 could complement [MIP24](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24#sentence-summary), an emergency voting protocol that may be initiated by any community member and manages urgent changes to the protocol. In contrast, the revised GOV 12 is a temporary bootstrapping measure authorizing only Governance Facilitators, under certain circumstances, to expedite revisions to the Atlas and Scopes Artifacts.  

Second, my rewrite assumes that the Governance Facilitators interpreting GOV 12 are comfortable applying fuzzy legal terms of art. (There would be distinct benefits: the civil law tradition is a rich one going back centuries. Arguably, it is as close as we can get to a stable, predictable foundation for drafting and interpreting governance logic.)

### 12: Scope Bootstrapping

#### 12.1 Bootstrapping Governance Votes

Before the Endgame State, time-sensitive situations may arise that pose a substantial threat to the functioning of Maker Governance. Under the conditions and limitations set out below, Governance Facilitators may propose a Governance Poll to edit the Atlas and Scope Artifacts to address such substantial threats. The decision to supersede Maker's customary governance protocols should not be taken lightly.  

This authority is permanently eliminated upon the launch of NewChain.

#### 12.2 Finding of "substantial threat"

A substantial threat to the functioning of Maker Governance is one that extends beyond causing mere inconvenience, annoyance or dissatisfaction. To be "substantial," the threat must be of both considerable *imminence* and *magnitude*. Therefore, a threat that is of considerable magnitude but is not likely to present in the near-term could not be characterized as "substantial."

To determine whether a substantial threat exists to the functioning of Maker Governance such that GOV 12 may be triggered, the Governance Facilitator must engage in a balancing inquiry. This inquiry explicitly weighs two interests: the imminence and magnitude of the threat, against the need to uphold a decentralized governance equilibrium pursuant to customary governance protocols. 

In undertaking this balancing inquiry, the Governance Facilitator is required to consider alternative measures to resolve the threat, which measures comport with Maker's customary governance protocols.

#### 12.3 General Protocol

Governance Facilitators may initiate a GOV 12 Governance Poll only if *all* of the following conditions are met:

- The Governance Facilitator must signal their intention to initiate a GOV 12 Governance Poll in a Forum post. The Forum post must document, in reasonable detail, the Facilitator's 1) analysis and reasoning in undertaking the balancing inquiry and 2) the proposed revisions to the Atlas/Scope Artifacts. The post must contain a formal conflict-of-interest declaration. 
- Two endorsements of the Governance Facilitator's post are required. One Facilitator *and* one Advisory Council Member of the impacted Scope(s) must post on the Forum their explicit endorsement. The endorsers must substantively explain their support of the Governance Facilitator's proposal. The endorsers must also include a formal conflict-of-interest declaration. 
- In order to qualify as a GOV 12 endorser, the Facilitator and Advisory Council Member must be currently active in their respective roles and otherwise be in good standing. If a Facilitator has received a Formal Warning per [GOV 4.2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP113#4-2-alignment-conserver-formal-warnings), they cannot qualify as a GOV 12 endorser.
- Once a Facilitator/Advisory Council Member has acted in the capacity of a GOV 12 endorser, they are prohibited from acting in such a capacity again until two full calendar months have passed. 

#### 12.4 Exceptions to the General Protocol

##### 12.4.1 Clear Mistakes

Excepted from the General Protocol are *clear* mistakes, such as typos or inconsistencies, in the text of the Atlas/Scope Artifacts that obstruct the critical functioning of Maker Governance. 

'Clear' typos/inconsistencies are defined as those for which substantive supporting documentation evincing the drafter's intent can be cited, and concerning whose interpretation, no reasonable disagreement can arise. Because of the nature of clear typos/inconsistencies, they can typically be corrected with a minimal amount of revision. 

In such a scenario, the Governance Facilitators must signal their intention via a Forum Post that briefly describes the clear typo/inconsistency, the impact on a critical function of Maker Governance and the proposed revision to the Atlas/Scope Artifacts. After the Forum post, the Facilitators may directly proceed to initiating the Governance Poll.   

##### 12.4.2 Launch Project Needs

Excepted from the General Protocol are Launch Project-related [needs](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP108#9-launch-project) deemed time-sensitive and high priority by Maker Core. In such a scenario, the Governance Facilitators must signal their intention via a Forum Post that briefly describes the Launch Project-related need (in such a way as to preserve the needed confidentiality) and the proposed revision to the Atlas/Scope Artifacts. After the Forum post, the Facilitators may directly proceed to initiating the Governance Poll.
