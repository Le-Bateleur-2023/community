# Poll: Activate USD eMode for sDAI, USDC and USDT markets on SparkLend Ethereum - October 2, 2023

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the [voting system](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling) on behalf of Spark Protocol and the Stability Facilitators. This Governance [Poll](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/governance-cycle/weekly-governance-cycle#weekly-governance-cycle-definitions-mip16c1) will be active for three days beginning on Monday, October 2 at 16:00 UTC.

**The outcome of this poll for the USDC and USDT markets will only be utilized if the concurrent Poll ID {X} and {X} result in a "Yes" vote.**

**This is a binary vote.**

- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option which you prefer.**
- **If you would accept either option, you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

Express your support or opposition to activating USD eMode for sDAI, USDC and USDT markets on SparkLend Ethereum, with the below parameters:

### USD Efficiency Mode

* LTV: **91%**.
* LT: **92%**.
* Liquidation penalty: **1%**.

Please review the proposal [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/proposal-to-onboard-usdc-and-usdt-to-sparklend-ethereum/22227) for more information about this proposed onboarding.

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* Phoenix Labs will prepare a Spark spell to activate USD eMode for sDAI, USDC and USDT markets on SparkLend Ethereum with the specified parameters.
* An upcoming Executive Vote will include a proposal to execute the Spark spell.
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
